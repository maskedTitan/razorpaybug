# razorpaybug
To summarise where we're at:
We successfully took payment with Razorpay, from within our iOS app using a webview, as recently as last night. It's been working for us, for a long time.
We haven't made any changes from our side, but it has stopped working, meaning our customers cannot make purchases using the iOS app. This is an urgent issue for us.
The fact we've been able to reproduce the problem in a brand new xcode project, using RazorPay's' own demo site, indicates that the problem is on RazorPay's side, and would be affecting other customers using RazorPay within an iOS webview.
